[1_model_subgroups.R](1_model_subgroups.R)
* Fit discrete-time logistic regression models for the full cohort and for each condition-specific subgroup
* Note: sbatch files run small, medium, and large subgroups separately (some subgroups need much more time/memory than others)

[2_model_subgroups_stratified.R]
* Fit discrete-time logistic regression models, stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility, and urbanicity
* Note: sbatch files run small, medium, and large subgroups separately (some subgroups need much more time/memory than others)

[3_calculate_prevalence.R](3_calculate_prevalence.R)
* Calculate prevelance of each condition (used in plots later)
